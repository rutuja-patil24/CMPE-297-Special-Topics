# Assignment - AI Agents with ADK 

## Overview

This repository contains the completed work for an assignment focused on building AI agents using the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. The project is divided into two main sections: implementing specified Codelabs and developing a custom agent application from a hackathon repository. Each section includes links to the code and a video walkthrough.

---

##  1. Part A: Codelabs Implementation

This section details the implementation of three core Codelabs on AI agents using the ADK. For each Codelab, a separate directory contains the archived code (either a Colab notebook or a desktop application script), a dedicated `README.md` file, and a link to a YouTube video demonstrating a code walkthrough and agent execution.

### 1.1. From Prototypes to Agents with ADK

**Task:** Implement the Codelab "From Prototypes to Agents with ADK" which introduces the fundamentals of moving from basic prototypes to fully functional agents with the ADK.

**Deliverables:**

### 1.3. Build a Travel Agent using MCP Toolbox for Databases and ADK

**Task:** Implement the Codelab "Build a Travel Agent using MCP Toolbox for Databases and ADK" focusing on building a more complex agentâ€”a travel agentâ€”by combining the ADK with the **MCP Toolbox** for database interactions.

**Deliverables:**
- ðŸ“‚ **Code:** [https://github.com/rutuja-patil24/CMPE-297-Special-Topics/tree/main/Build%20a%20Travel%20Agent%20using%20MCP%20Toolbox%20for%20Databases%20and%20ADK]

##  2. Part B: Agent Application from a Hackathon

This section showcases the implementation of an agent application selected from the provided **awesome-adk-agents** repository. The chosen application demonstrates the practical application of ADK principles in a real-world scenario.

**Task:** Select and implement an agent application from the [awesome-adk-agents repository](https://github.com/Sri-Krishna-V/awesome-adk-agents).

**Deliverables:**
- **Selected Hackathon Project:** [Link to specific project from the repository]
- ðŸ“‚ **Code:** [https://github.com/rutuja-patil24/CMPE-297-Special-Topics/tree/main/Agent%20Application%20from%20a%20Hackathon]
